#Vehicle Routing Problem Tester with React
This project allows users to test Esri's [Vehicle Routing Problem service](https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/network/api-reference/vehicle-routing-problem-service.htm), by providing an interface to manually input the service parameters with a form.

Since the service directory for this service is disabled online, it allows users to easily modify, add, and remove parameters with an interface.

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Deployment

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
